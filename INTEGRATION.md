# Mobile Animal Motion Capture - Integration Status

This document provides an overview of the integration work to port functionality from the original `mobile-animal-mocap` repository into the current application.

## Current Status

As of March 6, 2025, the application has been updated with the following components:

### Project Structure

The project structure has been updated to match the architecture of the original repository:

```
├── App.tsx                # Main app entry point
├── SimpleTestApp.js       # Simple test application (preserved)
├── src/
│   ├── app/               # App UI components
│   │   ├── components/    # Reusable UI components
│   │   ├── navigation/    # Navigation configuration
│   │   ├── screens/       # Application screens
│   │   └── state/         # Redux state management
│   ├── core/              # Core utilities
│   │   └── permissions/   # Permission handling logic
│   ├── data/              # Data models and storage
│   └── vision/            # Computer vision modules
```

### UI Components

The following UI components have been ported from the original repository:

- **InfoOverlay**: Displays real-time information about detection results, recording status, and frame rate
- **RecordButton**: Customizable record button with animation effects for capturing motion data
- **SkeletonOverlay**: Renders keypoints and skeleton connections for visualizing animal pose estimation

### Navigation

A stack-based navigation system has been implemented with the following screens:

- **HomeScreen**: Landing screen with options to navigate to other parts of the app
- **CaptureScreen**: Screen for capturing animal motion data
- **GalleryScreen**: Screen for viewing and managing recorded motion captures
- **SettingsScreen**: Screen for configuring application settings

### State Management

Redux state management has been set up with the following:

- **store.js**: Configures the Redux store
- **appSlice.js**: Manages application-wide state such as app mode and initialization status

### Dual Mode Support

The application now supports two modes:

- **Simple Mode**: Uses the original SimpleTestApp.js for basic functionality
- **Full Mode**: Uses the new navigation system and components

## Remaining Tasks

The following tasks are still in progress:

1. **Integrate AnimalDetectionDemo**: Port the core animal detection functionality from the original repo
2. **Test on Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra**: Ensure compatibility with target device
3. **Fix Permission Handling**: Update for modern Android devices (Android 13+)
4. **Update Documentation**: Add comprehensive usage instructions for new features

## Dependencies

The following key dependencies have been added:

- **@react-navigation/native and @react-navigation/stack**: For navigation system
- **@reduxjs/toolkit and react-redux**: For state management
- **react-native-safe-area-context**: For safe area handling
- **react-native-gesture-handler and react-native-reanimated**: Required by React Navigation

## Running the Application

### Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/nuwud/animal-mocap-app.git
cd animal-mocap-app
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```

3. Start the application:
```bash
npx expo start
```

### Switching Modes

- The app starts in Simple Mode by default
- Click "Try Full App" to switch to the navigation-based Full Mode
- In Full Mode, you can return to Simple Mode via Settings or the startup screen

## Stable Version

If you encounter issues with the integration, you can switch to the stable branch:

```bash
git checkout stable-v1
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
npx expo start
```
