# Mobile Animal Motion Capture - Integration Status

This document provides an overview of the integration work to port functionality from the original `mobile-animal-mocap` repository into the current application.

## Current Status

As of March 6, 2025, the application has been updated with the following components:

### Project Structure

The project structure has been updated to match the architecture of the original repository:

```
├── App.tsx                # Main app entry point
├── SimpleTestApp.js       # Simple test application (preserved)
├── src/
│   ├── app/               # App UI components
│   │   ├── components/    # Reusable UI components
│   │   ├── navigation/    # Navigation configuration
│   │   ├── screens/       # Application screens
│   │   └── state/         # Redux state management
│   ├── core/              # Core utilities
│   │   └── permissions/   # Permission handling logic
│   ├── data/              # Data models and storage
│   └── vision/            # Computer vision modules
```

### UI Components

The following UI components have been ported from the original repository:

- **InfoOverlay**: Displays real-time information about detection results, recording status, and frame rate
- **RecordButton**: Customizable record button with animation effects for capturing motion data
- **SkeletonOverlay**: Renders keypoints and skeleton connections for visualizing animal pose estimation

### Navigation

A stack-based navigation system has been implemented with the following screens:

- **HomeScreen**: Landing screen with options to navigate to other parts of the app
- **CaptureScreen**: Screen for capturing animal motion data (now with full detection functionality)
- **GalleryScreen**: Screen for viewing and managing recorded motion captures (connected to Redux state)
- **SettingsScreen**: Screen for configuring application settings

### State Management

Redux state management has been set up with the following:

- **store.js**: Configures the Redux store with combined reducers
- **appSlice.js**: Manages application-wide state such as app mode and initialization status
- **detectionSlice.js**: Manages animal detection state, recording status, and saved recordings

### Animal Detection

The core animal detection functionality has been integrated:

- **AnimalDetection.js**: Provides functions for animal detection using TensorFlow
- **CameraPermissions.js**: Handles camera permissions for both iOS and Android, with special handling for Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra
- Enhanced **CaptureScreen**: Using the Vision Camera library with TensorFlow for real-time animal detection and keypoint tracking

### Dual Mode Support

The application now supports two modes:

- **Simple Mode**: Uses the original SimpleTestApp.js for basic functionality
- **Full Mode**: Uses the new navigation system and components, including the animal detection

## Features Added

The integration has added the following features:

1. **Real-time Animal Detection**: Using TensorFlow to detect dogs and cats in the camera view
2. **Skeleton Visualization**: Rendering keypoints and skeletal structure of detected animals
3. **Motion Recording**: Ability to record and save animal motion sessions
4. **Recording Gallery**: View and manage saved recordings
5. **Camera Permissions**: Enhanced permission handling for modern Android devices

## Remaining Tasks

The following tasks are still in progress:

1. **Integration Testing**: Test all components working together on real devices
2. **Performance Optimization**: Optimize TensorFlow model loading and frame processing
3. **Data Export**: Add functionality to export motion capture data
4. **Documentation Updates**: Finalize documentation with comprehensive usage instructions

## Dependencies

The following key dependencies have been added:

- **@react-navigation/native and @react-navigation/stack**: For navigation system
- **@reduxjs/toolkit and react-redux**: For state management
- **react-native-vision-camera**: For camera access and frame processing
- **@tensorflow/tfjs and @tensorflow/tfjs-react-native**: For machine learning capabilities

## Running the Application

### Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/nuwud/animal-mocap-app.git
cd animal-mocap-app
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```

3. Start the application:
```bash
npx expo start
```

### Switching Modes

- The app starts in Simple Mode by default
- Click "Try Full App" to switch to the navigation-based Full Mode
- In Full Mode, you can navigate between Home, Capture, Gallery, and Settings screens

### Using Animal Detection

1. Navigate to the Capture screen
2. Grant camera permissions when prompted
3. Wait for the animal detection model to load
4. Point your camera at a dog or cat
5. Press the Record button to start recording motion data
6. View your recordings in the Gallery screen

## Stable Version

If you encounter issues with the integration, you can switch to the stable branch:

```bash
git checkout stable-v1
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
npx expo start
```
