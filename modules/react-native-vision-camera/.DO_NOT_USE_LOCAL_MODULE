This local copy of the react-native-vision-camera module is disabled.
The app now uses the version from node_modules instead to avoid duplicate module errors.

If you need to make local modifications to the module, please:
1. Move any changes from this local copy to node_modules version
2. Use patch-package to create patches for your modifications
3. Remove this local copy from the modules directory

See issue #12 for more details.
